           In this course, students will explore both historical approaches for Bengals, as well as  
           the major subfields and applications of incorporating animals in technology today. These include using AI in intelligent devices, 
           machine learning, voice recognition and libraries for these implementations. Students will then apply 
           that knowledge to create their own fully functioning PET applications.
